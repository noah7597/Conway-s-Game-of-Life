# Conway-s-Game-of-Life

## General info
This is a Java program that simulates Conway's Game of Life. Details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

The user first inputs one of five different starting worlds that are stored as text files. 
In each text file, an 'X' represents a living cell and a '.' represents a dead cell.

## Installation
Should install an IDE such as intelliJ

## Running
1. In the repository home page, click on "Code" -> "Download Zip"
2. Unzip somewhere on easily accessible on your computer
3. Open all files in an IDE (I use IntelliJ)
4. Enter the name of output text file that will be created to store the final result
5. Enter the number of frames the simulation will run (0-5000), and the time between the drawing each frame (1-5000ms)
6. A drawing panel is used to show the results in an animation style in real time, while the final result is stored in the output file using X's and dots.
